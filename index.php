		<h2>Thin air</h2>
		<p>
			Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic,
			flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. 
			Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, 
			and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, 
			squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater.
			They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.

		<p>
			Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera (/kaɪˈrɒptərə/; from the Greek χείρ - cheir, "hand"[2] and πτερόν 
			- pteron, "wing"[3]) whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals naturally capable 
			of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels,
			gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats do not flap their entire forelimbs, 
			as birds do, but instead flap their spread-out digits,[4] which are very long and covered with a thin membrane or patagium.
